# Adjoint-based optimization and inverse design of photonic devices.

This repository holds my dissertation for the PhD degree in Applied Physics from Stanford University.

The main file is `main.tex`, which links the chapters in `chapters/` and compiles the full thesis.

Click [here](https://github.com/twhughes/PhD_Thesis/blob/master/main.pdf) to view the current pdf.

Running `bash startup.sh` will open the pdf and sublime text in fullscreen and split mode for easy editing if you are on a Mac.

`commands.tex` holds the custom commands used in the text.


Enjoy!
