  Abstract                 = {Nano-photonic technologies of GaAs-based two-dimensional photonic crystal (2DPC) slab waveguides (WGs) and InAs-based quantum dots (QDs) are reviewed for a symmetrical Mach–Zehnder (SMZ) type, ultra-small and ultra-fast all-optical switch (PC-SMZ) and logic device. As the ﬁrst phase, ultra-fast (∼ ps) and ultra-low energy (∼100 fJ) switching has been demonstrated using a chip 600 µm × 300 µm in size. The second phase is to create a PC-SMZ-based ultra-fast photonic logic switch with a latch function for a future ultra-fast photonic digital processor. One of the priority subjects is to establish a new design method, i.e., topology optimization (TO) method of 2DPC-WGs with wide/ﬂat bandwidth, high transmittance and low reﬂectivity. Another one is to develop selective-area-grown, high-density and highly uniform InAs QDs with large optical nonlinearity (ONL) by using a metal-mask (MM) molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) growth method. Recent results regarding these two subjects encourage us to reach the ﬁnal goal.},

Among the different theoretical frameworks that have been used to study nonlinear photonic structures, we particularly focus on the application of both perturbation theory and coupled-mode theory to the analysis of complex nonlinear nanophotonic devices. This description is illustrated on several examples of how these techniques can be used to design photonic-crystal-based nonlinear devices. In addition, in all these examples, we show that the predictions made by the two mentioned techniques are in a good agreement with the numerical results obtained from a nonlinear ﬁnite-difference-time-domain approach to these problems.},

  Abstract                 = {Nonlinear photonic-crystal microresonators offer unique fundamental ways of enhancing a variety of nonlinear optical processes. This enhancement improves the performance of nonlinear optical devices to such an extent that their corresponding operation powers and switching times are suitable for their implementation in realistic ultrafast integrated optical devices. Here, we review three different nonlinear optical phenomena that can be strongly enhanced in photonic crystal microcavities. First, we discuss a system in which this enhancement has been successfully demonstrated both theoretically and experimentally, namely, a photonic crystal cavity showing optical bistability properties. In this part, we also present the physical basis for this dramatic improvement with respect to the case of traditional nonlinear devices based on nonlinear Fabry-Perot etalons. Secondly, we show how nonlinear photonic crystal cavities can be also used to obtain complete second-harmonic frequency conversion at very low input powers. Finally, we demonstrate that the nonlinear susceptibility of materials can be strongly modified via the so-called Purcell effect, present in the resonant cavities under study.},

Its χ(3), 1.8×10−12esu, is more than three times to GeS2 glass. Their instant NLO responses are within 120fs pulse duration.

The designs are obtained using gradient-based topology optimization coupled with a time-domain Maxwell's equations solver. Direct application of the optimization procedure results in devices with a performance which is very sensitive to geometric manufacturing errors (under- or over-etching). Such behavior is undesirable and robustness is achieved by optimizing for several design realizations. The possible geometric uncertainties are modeled by random variables. It is shown that the designs are insensitive with respect to variations of signal parameters, such as signal amplitudes and phase shifts. The obtained robust designs of a 1D photonic switch can substantially outperform simple bandgap designs, known from the literature, where switching takes place due to the bandgap shift produced by a strong control pulse.},

  Abstract                 = {Dielectric microstructures have generated much interest in recent years as a means of accelerating charged particles when powered by solid state lasers. The acceleration gradient (or particle energy gain per unit length) is an important figure of merit. To design structures with high acceleration gradients, we explore the adjoint variable method, a highly efficient technique used to compute the sensitivity of an objective with respect to a large number of parameters. With this formalism, the sensitivity of the acceleration gradient of a dielectric structure with respect to its entire spatial permittivity distribution is calculated by the use of only two full-field electromagnetic simulations, the original and \&\#x02018;adjoint\&\#x02019;. The adjoint simulation corresponds physically to the reciprocal situation of a point charge moving through the accelerator gap and radiating. Using this formalism, we perform numerical optimizations aimed at maximizing acceleration gradients, which generate fabricable structures of greatly improved performance in comparison to previously examined geometries.},

  Abstract                 = {We introduce Adam, an algorithm for first-order gradient-based optimization of stochastic objective functions, based on adaptive estimates of lower-order moments. The method is straightforward to implement, is computationally efficient, has little memory requirements, is invariant to diagonal rescaling of the gradients, and is well suited for problems that are large in terms of data and/or parameters. The method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework. Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods. Finally, we discuss AdaMax, a variant of Adam based on the infinity norm.},

The adjoint approach calculates shape derivatives at all points in space, but requires only two “forward” simulations. Geometrical shape parameterization is by the level set method. Our adjoint design optimization is applied to a Silicon photonics Y-junction splitter that had previously been investigated by stochastic methods. Owing to the speed of calculating shape derivatives within the adjoint method, convergence is much faster, within a larger design space. This is an extremely efficient method for the design of complex electromagnetic components.},

  Abstract                 = {A pulse-delaying optimization scheme based on topology optimization for transient response of photonic crystal structures (PhCs) is formulated to obtain slow-light devices. The optimization process is started from a qualified W1 PhC waveguide design with group index ng≈40 obtained from a simple Edisonian parameter search. Based on this, the proposed pulse delaying and subsequent pulse restoring strategies yield a design that increases the group index by 75\% to ng≈70±10\% for an operational full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) bandwidth BFWHM=6 nm, and simultaneously minimizes interface penalty losses between the access ridge and the W1 PhC waveguide. To retain periodicity and symmetry, the active design set is limited to the in-/outlet region and a distributed supercell, and manufacturability is further enhanced by density filtering techniques combined with material phase projections.},

In paricular, the L3, H0, and H1 defects are the most popular and widespread cavity designs, due to their compactness, simplicity, and small mode volume. For these cavities, the current best optimal designs still result in Q-values of a few times 10(5) only, namely one order of magnitude below the bound set by fabrication imperfections and material absorption in silicon. Here, we use a genetic algorithm to find a global maximum of the quality factor of these designs, by varying the positions of few neighbouring holes. We consistently find Q-values above one million - one order of magnitude higher than previous designs. Furthermore, we study the effect of disorder on the optimal designs and conclude that a similar improvement is also expected experimentally in state-of-the-art systems.},

We have designed a silicon wavelength demultiplexer that splits 1,300 nm and 1,550 nm light from an input waveguide into two output waveguides, and fabricated and characterized several devices. The devices display low insertion loss (∼2 dB), low crosstalk ({\textless}−11 dB) and wide bandwidths ({\textgreater}100 nm). The device footprint is 2.8 × 2.8 μm2, making this the smallest dielectric wavelength splitter.},

  Abstract                 = {Laser-induced breakdown and damage to transparent materials has remained an active area of research for four decades. In this paper we review the basic mechanisms that lead to laser-induced breakdown and damage and present a summary of some open questions in the ﬁeld. We present a method for measuring the threshold intensity required to produce breakdown and damage in the bulk, as opposed to on the surface, of the material. Using this technique, we measure the material band-gap and laser-wavelength dependence of the threshold intensity for bulk damage using femtosecond laser pulses. Based on these thresholds, we determine the relative role of different nonlinear ionization mechanisms for different laser and material parameters.},

Here, we experimentally show an average transmission efficiency of greater than 70\% (peak transmission efficiency of ∼80\%) and an extinction ratio greater than 10 dB within a bandwidth of 32 nm. Simulation results indicate that our device is tolerant to fabrication errors of up to ±20 nm in the device thickness. We also designed, fabricated and characterized a mode-converting polarization beamsplitter, which not only separates the two polarization states but also connects one multimode input waveguide to two single-mode output waveguides.},

Here, we present an implementation of a memetic algorithm based on mixed integer programming, which is especially suited for practical broadband optimization of layered thin-film materials. In our implementation, the optimization variables consist of a list of discrete variables that represents different dielectric materials, along with a list of continuous variables that represents the thicknesses of each material. As a set of concrete demonstrations, we optimize the spectra of a radiative cooling device and an incandescent light bulb filter. The resulting structures from the optimization can, by using more materials, achieve better performance than their counterparts in the literature while using fewer numbers of material layers.},

The pump light originated from a picosecond Nd:YAG laser operating at 1064 nm and a tunable optical parametric generator and amplifier (OPG/OPA) was used as a source for the probe light. A peak material Raman gain coefficient of (155 ± 11) x 10-13 m/W has been measured for the As24S38Se38 glass. A reversible photodarkening effect which responds to picosecond pulses is also reported. Finally, surface optical damage threshold measurements were found to be less than 9 GW/cm2 for the reported samples, values which are comparable to some TeO2-based glasses with lower nonlinearities.},

  Abstract                 = {We show that the adjoint variable method can be combined with the multi-frequency finite-difference frequency-domain method for efficient sensitivity calculations, enabling the systematic optimization of active nanophotonic devices. As a proof of principle demonstration, we have optimized a dynamic isolator structure in two-dimensions, resulting in the reduction of the length of the modulated regions by a factor of two, while retaining good performance in the isolation ratio and insertion loss.},

  Abstract                 = {We have precisely measured the Raman shift of photonic crystal silicon heterostructure nanocavities for Raman laser applications. We utilized a near-infrared excitation laser of wavelength 1.42 μm in order to avoid local sample heating and exploited two high-Q nanocavity modes to calibrate the Raman frequency. The measured Raman shift was 15.606 THz (520.71 cm−1) with a small uncertainty of 1.0 × 10−3 THz. In addition, we investigated the compressive stress generated in a photonic crystal slab in which a 5.1 × 10−3 THz blue shift of the Raman peak and a slight warpage of the slab were observed. We also demonstrated that the stress could be eliminated by using a cantilever structure.},

  Abstract                 = {First-principles simulation of active nanophotonic devices is indispensable to optical engineering. However, direct simulation of active devices with traditional time-domain methods have been prohibitively expensive due to the inherently large time-scale difference between optical and modulation frequencies. To overcome this challenge, we present a multi-frequency finite-difference frequency-domain algorithm that efficiently performs first-principles steady-state simulations in active devices. We validate our algorithm by simulating a modulated waveguide device and find that the result of the simulation is in excellent agreement with that of coupled mode theory, while also revealing features that are neglected in typical coupled mode theory treatments. We further demonstrate that this algorithm makes it possible to effectively simulate realistic active optical devices. Our algorithm should facilitate and expedite the design and analysis of active nanophotonic components.},
